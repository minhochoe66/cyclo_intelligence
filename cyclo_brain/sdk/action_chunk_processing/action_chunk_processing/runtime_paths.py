"""Source-tree path fallbacks for runtime modules.

The two-process policy runtime needs to find sibling SDK packages
(`robot_client`, `action_chunk_processing`, `zenoh_ros2_sdk`) and the
orchestrator's per-robot YAMLs at module-import time. In a container
deployment the env vars ACTION_CHUNK_PROCESSING_SDK_PATH / ROBOT_CLIENT_SDK_PATH /
ORCHESTRATOR_CONFIG_PATH point at bind-mounted directories and that's
all that's needed. When running from a source checkout (host-side dev
or unit tests), the runtime files live deep in the tree and we need
to walk up to the repo root — that's what this helper handles.

    so an unset env var maps to a sensible source-tree path during dev,

    COPY'd into a shallow location like /app/runtime/ inside a container
