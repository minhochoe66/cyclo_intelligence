"""Shared ROS2 message construction helpers for the policy runtime.

The two-process policy runtime publishes joint commands via
zenoh_ros2_sdk's generated message classes, which are stricter than rclpy:
every IDL field is required as a positional/keyword arg and nested
structs must be real generated instances (not dicts). On top of that,
ros2_control's joint_trajectory_controller has its own ergonomics
constraints — it rejects trajectories with non-empty velocities /
accelerations / effort unless the underlying controller has the
matching command interface. These helpers consolidate those rules so a
typo or missing field doesn't reappear in a new backend's control path.

The expected ``classes`` dict is produced once by the runtime and reused on the
hot path to avoid repeated ``get_message_class`` lookups.

        joint_names: Joint names in the publish order.

    Why empty arrays for velocities/accelerations/effort:
        ros2_control's joint_trajectory_controller rejects messages with
        populated ``effort`` unless the controller has an ``effort`` command
        interface (and similarly for ``velocities`` / ``accelerations`` on
        position-only controllers). rclpy's default-constructed
        ``JointTrajectoryPoint()`` leaves these as empty sequences, which
        is what we mirror here.
