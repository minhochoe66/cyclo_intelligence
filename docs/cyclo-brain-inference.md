# Cyclo Brain Inference Manual

This document explains how to run Cyclo Brain inference from the Cyclo Intelligence UI. It describes the runtime after the recent inference architecture refactor.

- Cyclo Brain policy backends run as two Python processes: `main-runtime` and `engine-process`.
- The UI selects LeRobot ACT and GR00T N1.7 from the same Inference page.
- Docker backends are controlled from the UI with `ON`, `Restart`, and `OFF`.
- Models can be selected by Hugging Face repo ID or by a local policy checkpoint dropbox path.

## 1. Runtime Architecture

Cyclo Brain splits each policy container into two processes.

| Process | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `main-runtime` | Receives external inference commands, owns session state, pops one action at a time from the action chunk buffer, and publishes robot command topics. |
| `engine-process` | Loads the policy model, reads robot observations, and computes action chunks. It never publishes robot commands. |

The runtime flow is:

1. The UI or orchestrator sends `LOAD`, `START`, `STOP`, or `UNLOAD` style commands.
2. `main-runtime` receives the command and updates the session state.
3. `main-runtime` asks `engine-process` to load a model or compute actions through an internal Zenoh service.
4. `engine-process` reads observations, runs model inference, and returns an `action_list`.
5. `main-runtime` pushes the action chunk into `ActionChunkProcessor`, then publishes one action per control-loop tick.

LeRobot and GR00T share the same runtime contract. Only the engine-side model loading, preprocessing, and prediction implementation differs.

## 2. Open the UI

On the robot, start from the repository root:

```bash
cd /home/robotis/cyclo_intelligence
git pull
./docker/container.sh start
```

Open the UI in a browser:

```text
http://<robot-ip>/
```

For local access:

```text
http://127.0.0.1/
```

On the Home page, select the robot type first.

![Home Robot Type](./assets/cyclo-brain-inference/01-home-robot-type.png)

1. Press `Refresh Robot Type List` to load available robot configs.
2. Select the current robot in `Select Robot Type`.
3. Press `Set Robot Type` so the orchestrator and policy runtime use the same robot config.
4. Click `Inference` in the left sidebar.

## 3. Inference Page Layout

![Inference ACT Setup](./assets/cyclo-brain-inference/02-inference-act-setup.png)

The Inference page has four main areas.

| Area | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Left sidebar | Navigation: Home, Record, Training, Inference, BT Manager, Data Tools, Replay |
| Top status bar | Robot type, ROS connection state, CPU/RAM/Storage state, and inference control buttons |
| Center view | Camera images, 3D viewer, and topic monitor |
| Right Task Information panel | Model selection, Docker backend control, policy path, and inference/control settings |

## 4. Model Selection

Choose the policy backend from `Task Information > Model`.

![Model List](./assets/cyclo-brain-inference/03-inference-model-list-coming-soon.png)

Currently available models:

| Model | Backend | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LeRobot (ACT)` | `lerobot_server` | Loads a LeRobot ACT checkpoint. It does not use task instructions. |
| `GR00T N1.7` | `groot_server` | Loads an NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1.7 checkpoint. It uses task instructions. |

The following models are shown as `Coming Soon`. They are visible in the UI but cannot be selected until their runtime path is validated.

- `GreenVLA`
- `OpenPI`
- `RLDX-1`

## 5. Docker Backend Control

After selecting a model, the matching Docker backend control appears in the right panel.

| Button | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `ON` | Creates/starts the policy container from a local image if it does not exist. Starts a stopped container. Restarts an already running container to reset the runtime. |
| `Restart` | Restarts the policy container. Use this after model-load failures, stale services, or CUDA memory cleanup needs. |
| `OFF` | Stops the policy container. It does not delete the container or image. |

Status badges:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Running` | The Docker container is running. |
| `Stopped` | The container exists but is not running. |
| `Not created` | The container has not been created yet. Press `ON` to create it when the local image exists. |
| `Image missing` | The required Docker image is not available locally. Pull or install the image first. |
| `Warming up` | The container is running, but runtime process readiness is still being checked. |

Two process states are shown.

| Process | `Up` means | If `Down` or `Unknown` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Main` | The `main-runtime` s6 service is alive. It handles external inference commands and the control loop. | Press `Restart` to bring the backend up again. |
| `Engine` | The `engine-process` s6 service is alive. It handles model loading and action chunk inference. | Model load or inference service calls may fail; use `Restart` first. |

`Main Up` and `Engine Up` only mean the processes are alive. They do not mean a model is already loaded. Model loading happens after pressing `Start`, using the current `Policy Path`.

## 6. ACT Inference Flow

ACT uses the LeRobot backend.

1. Select `LeRobot (ACT)` in `Model`.
2. Check that `ACT Docker` is `Running`.
3. Check that both `Main` and `Engine` are `Up`.
4. Enter the model path in `Policy Path`.

Example Hugging Face repo ID:

```text
Dongkkka/Act_test_20k
```

Example local checkpoint path:

```text
/policy_checkpoints/lerobot/Act_test_20k
```

5. Set `Inference Hz` to match the model action generation rate. The ACT test model usually uses `15`.
6. Set `Control Hz` to match the robot command publish rate. The default is `100`.
7. `Max Skip Ahead (s)` is the time window where the chunk aligner may skip ahead. Start with the default `0.3`.
8. Press the top `Start` button.
9. When the status changes from `Loading model...` to `Inferencing`, action publishing has started.
10. Press `Stop` to pause. The model remains loaded for pause/resume.
11. Press `Clear` to fully stop inference and clear the model/session/buffer state.

ACT does not use task instructions, so the `Task Instruction` input is hidden.

## 7. GR00T N1.7 Inference Flow

GR00T uses the GR00T backend.

![Inference GR00T Setup](./assets/cyclo-brain-inference/04-inference-groot-instruction.png)

1. Select `GR00T N1.7` in `Model`.
2. Check that `GR00T Docker` is `Running`.
3. Check that both `Main` and `Engine` are `Up`.
4. Enter a natural-language task instruction in `Task Instruction`.
5. Enter the model path in `Policy Path`.

Example Hugging Face repo ID:

```text
Dongkkka/cyclo_intelligence_groot_n1.7_model
```

Example local checkpoint path:

```text
/policy_checkpoints/groot/cyclo_intelligence_groot_n1.7_model
```

6. Press `Start`.
7. To update the task instruction during inference, edit the text and press `Update Task Instruction`.
8. Use `Stop` to pause and `Clear` to fully unload/clear the session.

GR00T N1.7 currently runs in PyTorch eager mode by default in the UI path. TensorRT action-head execution is a separate validation path; the UI default prioritizes stable runtime behavior.

## 8. Inference Control Buttons

The top `Inference` control bar is shared by all backends.

| Button | Shortcut | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Start` | `Space` | In READY state, loads the model and starts inference. In PAUSED state with the same policy path, resumes inference. |
| `Stop` | `Ctrl+Shift+S` | Pauses inference. The model remains in memory. |
| `Clear` | `Esc` | Stops inference and clears the model, session, and action buffer. |
| `Record` | `R` | Starts recording inference results when the `Record` checkbox is enabled. |
| `Save` | `R` | Saves the current inference recording. |
| `Discard` | - | Discards the current inference recording. |

If `Start` is disabled, check the Docker backend status in the right panel. Common causes are `OFF`, `Image missing`, or `Warming up`.

## 9. Model File Locations

Docker Compose bind-mounts host checkpoint directories into each policy container.

| Backend | Host path | Container path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LeRobot | `/home/robotis/cyclo_intelligence/cyclo_brain/policy/lerobot/checkpoints` | `/policy_checkpoints/lerobot` |
| GR00T | `/home/robotis/cyclo_intelligence/cyclo_brain/policy/groot/checkpoints` | `/policy_checkpoints/groot` |

If the host model is here:

```text
/home/robotis/cyclo_intelligence/cyclo_brain/policy/lerobot/checkpoints/Act_test_20k
```

Enter this path in the UI:

```text
/policy_checkpoints/lerobot/Act_test_20k
```

You can also enter a Hugging Face repo ID directly.

```text
Dongkkka/Act_test_20k
Dongkkka/cyclo_intelligence_groot_n1.7_model
```

To pre-download a model, run `snapshot_download` inside the matching policy container.

LeRobot ACT:

```bash
docker exec -it lerobot_server bash
python - <<'PY'
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
snapshot_download(
    "Dongkkka/Act_test_20k",
    local_dir="/policy_checkpoints/lerobot/Act_test_20k",
)
PY
```

GR00T N1.7:

```bash
docker exec -it groot_server bash
python - <<'PY'
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
snapshot_download(
    "Dongkkka/cyclo_intelligence_groot_n1.7_model",
    local_dir="/policy_checkpoints/groot/cyclo_intelligence_groot_n1.7_model",
)
PY
```

The Hugging Face cache remains under this host directory in the Compose setup:

```text
/home/robotis/cyclo_intelligence/docker/huggingface
```

## 10. Docker Image Preparation

A local Docker image is required for normal operation.

LeRobot:

```bash
docker pull robotis/lerobot-zenoh:1.0.0-arm64
```

GR00T:

```bash
docker pull robotis/groot-zenoh:1.2.0-arm64
```

During local development, LeRobot may also exist with the temporary tag `robotis/lerobot-zenoh:arm64`; the supervisor accepts it as a local image candidate. GR00T is expected to use the release tag `1.2.0-arm64`.

## 11. Troubleshooting

### Start Is Disabled

Check the backend status in the right panel.

- `Image missing`: pull the Docker image.
- `Stopped` or `Not created`: press `ON`.
- `Warming up`: wait until both `Main` and `Engine` are `Up`.
- `Main Down` or `Engine Down`: press `Restart`.

### Model Load Failed

1. Check that `Policy Path` is correct.
2. If you use a local path, make sure it is a container path such as `/policy_checkpoints/...`.
3. If you use a Hugging Face repo ID, check network access and token permissions.
4. Press `Clear` to reset the session.
5. If it still fails, press Docker backend `Restart`, then press `Start` again.

### Actions Look Wrong or Robot Commands Are Missing

1. Check camera, joint state, and command topic status in Topic Monitor.
2. Check that `Inference Hz` matches the training data FPS.
3. Check that `Control Hz` matches the robot command publish rate.
4. Check that the ACT/GR00T model's expected camera keys match the current robot config.
5. Press `Clear`, then start again.

### Turn Docker Back On After OFF

`OFF` stops the container but does not delete it. Press `ON` to reuse and start the existing container. If you need a fresh container, delete the old container with CLI Docker/Compose commands and create it again.
