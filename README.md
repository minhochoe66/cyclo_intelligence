# Cyclo Intelligence

Open-source full-stack Physical AI platform — data recording, conversion,
training, inference, and robot execution in a single repository.

For detailed usage and tutorials, please refer to the documentation below.
  - [Documentation for AI Worker](https://ai.robotis.com/)

## Clone

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/cyclo_intelligence.git
cd cyclo_intelligence
```

### Updating an existing checkout

After switching branches or pulling a new release, sync the pinned
submodule commits from the repository root:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Folders at a glance

| Folder | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`shared/`](shared/) | Robot configs, IO helpers, logger |
| [`cyclo_brain/`](cyclo_brain/) | Training + inference (per-backend containers under `policy/`) |
| [`cyclo_data/`](cyclo_data/) | Data recording / conversion / hub upload (ROS2 node) |
| [`orchestrator/`](orchestrator/) | Session state, UI, behaviour-tree control (ships React UI) |
| [`interfaces/`](interfaces/) | ROS2 msg / srv definitions |
| [`docker/`](docker/) | Unified compose, s6-services, Dockerfiles (arm64 / amd64) |
| [`docs/`](docs/) | Architecture |

## Prerequisites

- Docker 24+ with the Compose plugin (`docker compose version`)
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit configured as the default runtime
  (`docker info | grep "Default Runtime: nvidia"`)
- ~35 GB free disk for the three pre-built images
- Ports 80, 8100, 9090 free on the host

No Docker Hub login is required — the published images
(`robotis/cyclo-intelligence`, `robotis/groot-zenoh`,
`robotis/lerobot-zenoh`) are public and pulled anonymously by default.

## Quick start (Jetson / ARM64 — same on AMD64)

```bash
docker/container.sh start          # pull + start unified image (no rebuild)
docker/container.sh status         # check s6 service state
# UI:          http://localhost/
# control API: http://localhost/api/health
docker/container.sh start-lerobot  # policy on demand (LOAD via UI)
docker/container.sh start-groot    # policy on demand (LOAD via UI)
docker/container.sh stop           # tear everything down
```

`docker/container.sh` auto-detects `uname -m`, so the same commands work on
both Jetson and an AMD64 workstation. The default `start*` flow uses the
pre-built image from Docker Hub. Pass `--build` to rebuild from local
Dockerfile (only needed when iterating on Dockerfile changes).

### Troubleshooting

- **`personal access token is expired` on pull** — A previous `docker
  login` left an expired token in `~/.docker/config.json`. Run
  `docker logout` to clear it; the published images pull anonymously.
- **`Default Runtime: runc` instead of `nvidia`** — Install the NVIDIA
  Container Toolkit and set `nvidia` as the default runtime in
  `/etc/docker/daemon.json`, then `sudo systemctl restart docker`.
- **Use SSD storage on a robot** — containers always mount
  `docker/workspace` and `docker/huggingface`. On robots with NVMe storage,
  `docker/container.sh start` uses `/mnt/ssd/cyclo_intelligence` when that
  path is writable by replacing those repo-local paths with symlinks. Existing
  local-only files are migrated to SSD without overwriting files already on
  SSD; any remaining local conflicts are preserved next to the original path.
  Use
  `CYCLO_STORAGE_MODE=ssd` to require SSD storage, or
  `CYCLO_STORAGE_MODE=local` to keep repo-local directories.
- **`/var/run/robotis/agent_sockets/...: permission denied`** —
  `container.sh` will create this with `mkdir -p` (using `sudo` if
  needed). If sudo prompts, grant once or pre-create the directory.

## Architecture

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for runtime topology
and data flow.

## Submodules (pinned commit)

- `cyclo_brain/sdk/zenoh_ros2_sdk/` ← [ROBOTIS-GIT/zenoh_ros2_sdk](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/zenoh_ros2_sdk)
- `cyclo_brain/policy/lerobot/lerobot/` ← [huggingface/lerobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot)
- `cyclo_brain/policy/groot/Isaac-GR00T/` ← [NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T)

These paths are pinned to exact commits by the parent repository. If a
submodule directory is empty or stale, run
`git submodule update --init --recursive` before building images.
